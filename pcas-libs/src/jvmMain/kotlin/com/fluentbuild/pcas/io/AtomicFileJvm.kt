/**
 * A helper class for performing atomic operations on a file by writing to a new file and renaming it into the
 * place of the original file after the write has successfully completed.
 * The new file created when writing will be the same file path with ".new" appended.
 *
 * Atomic file guarantees file integrity by ensuring that a file has been completely written and
 * sync'd to disk before renaming it to the original file.
 *
 * Atomic file does not confer any file locking semantics. Do not use this class when the file may
 * be accessed or modified concurrently by multiple threads or processes. The caller is responsible
 * for ensuring appropriate mutual exclusion invariants whenever it accesses the file.
